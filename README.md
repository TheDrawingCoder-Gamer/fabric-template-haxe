# Fabric Example Mod

## Haxe specifics
### Limitations

Haxe used to not be able to handle type contraints, but this has been sidestepped by directly compiling to JVM, and using the jar as the input. This should be fully working! Please report any bugs. 
## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

To set this up you need to provide a 1.16.5 jar file. This (sadly) requires you to have built a loom project before (i reccomend building the base project).
Then in your user folder (one of the things in C:/Users on windows) you'll want to go to .gradle/caches/fabric-loom and find a folder that has "1.16.5" somewhere in the name. Take the jar that has nothing on the end out of it (so the normal jar, not sources or dev) and put that in "javathings" and rename it to 1.16.5.jar

if you want to upgrade this you can replace all the gradle files, `src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json` and the java things. you can get the java thing files from [fabricmc's maven thing](https://maven.fabricmc.net/) ([fabric loader](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-loader/), [yarn](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/yarn/), [fabric-api](https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-api/fabric-api/)) and haxe should manage
